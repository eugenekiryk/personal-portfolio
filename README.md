# Personal Portfolio Website

My personal portfolio website bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can now edit pages, components and styles in the respective folders. 

## Built with

- CSS Modules, vanilla CSS, Flexbox
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React.js framework

Designed and implemented by me, [Eugene Kiryk](https://github.com/eugenekiryk).
